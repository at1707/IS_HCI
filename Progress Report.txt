Progress Report 
=================================================

Week 01/15 - 01/22
	• Searched for papers related to usability evaluation of eGovernment websites
	• Read the paper Evaluating Usability of Web-Based Electronic Government: Users’ Perspective
	  by Zhao Huang and Laurence Brooks , INTERACT 2011 proceedings
	• The paper is survey-based. Uses survey questionnaire to collect responses from praticipants.
	• The users are given a task sheet where they perform tasks as specified in the sheet and then 
	  fill the questionnaire.
 	• The paper uses the famous Nielsen's usability heuristics for usability evaluation and
 	  extends those to suit these eGov websites layouts and needs.
 	• The paper evaluates three websites - London Authority 1, 2 and 3. The websites strengths and 	 problems are then identified.
 	• User's perception of the websites, the ease of use and the accessibility features are 
 	  assessed based on the experiences of the users.
	• The paper tends to give insights to designers to use these problems as a point of
	  improvement of these websites so that the users can have a better experience while navigating through these websites
